# Project Log

**April 18, 2023**
- Continued to work on LeetCode 3: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
  - Watched the conceptual part of the NeetCode video, but was still unable to implement a working solution.
  - I should outline my solution manually again to see where my error is. I don't think I need to see the worked solution in the NeetCode video to get this one.

- Attempted LeetCode 3: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters.
  - Got very close to a working solution, but had one small oversight in my solution.
  - #TIP: I need to be better about coming up with test cases before coming up with a solution. I might have caught that one if I'd paid close attention to my test cases.
