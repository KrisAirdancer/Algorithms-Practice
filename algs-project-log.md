# Project Log

**April 24, 2023**
- Attempted to pseudo-code the solution to LeetCode 424.
  - Didn't make much progress.
  - Re-watched the conceptual portion of the NeetCode video.
  - Tried to pseudo-code a new solution.
  - Need to break the pseudo-code down a bit more, then try to implement my solution.

**April 23, 2022**
- Watched the conceptual part of the NeetCode video for LeetCode 424: Longest Repeating Character Replacement.
  - Wrote out how the solution in my own words.
  - Next, I need to outline the pseudo-code and then implement it.
- Started pseudo coding solution to LeetCode 424.
  - Wrote out the valid window condition in a confusing way and got myself mixed up.
  - Come back tomorrow and write it down better (don't look at the old version) so it isn't as confusing. Because it's not confusing, I just over complicated it.

- Started LeetCode 424: Longest Repeating Character Replacement
  - Came up with a promising idea, but it has a few clear limitations (unhandled edge cases).
  - This solution does not use a sliding window, and I know this is a sliding window problem. I need to either come up with a super clever solution (never a good idea) or try to work out a sliding window solution.

- Completed LeetCode 3: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
  - Managed to complete it without looking at an existing solution.
  - Did have to watch the NeetCode conceptual explanation to find my error however (this was done yesterday).

**April 18, 2023**
- Continued to work on LeetCode 3: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
  - Watched the conceptual part of the NeetCode video, but was still unable to implement a working solution.
  - I should outline my solution manually again to see where my error is. I don't think I need to see the worked solution in the NeetCode video to get this one.

**April 17, 2023**
- Attempted LeetCode 3: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters.
  - Got very close to a working solution, but had one small oversight in my solution.
  - #TIP: I need to be better about coming up with test cases before coming up with a solution. I might have caught that one if I'd paid close attention to my test cases.

**April 16, 2023**
- Completed LeetCode 121: Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
  - Redid this problem as part of NeetCode 150.

**April 15, 2023**
- Completed LeetCode 11: Container With Most Water

**April 14, 2023**
- Started working through LeetCode 11: Container With Most Water.
  - Just got a basic idea for the problem and started outlining the problem.
