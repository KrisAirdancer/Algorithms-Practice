# Project Log

**May 11, 2023**
- Completed LeetCode 875: Koko Eating Bananas
  - Started this one yesterday and didn't manage to finish.
  - This was a tricky one, but I managed to complete it without looking at solution code. I did, however, have to watch the conceptual part of the NeetCode video.
- Completed LeetCode 153: Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array.
  - This one is giving me the run-around.
  - I wasn't able to arrive at a conceptual solution; the conceptual solution from the NeetCode video mostly made sense, but I think some of the finer details went over my head; and finally, I had trouble implementing a solution even after watching the implementation portion of the NeetCode video. Basically, I don't really feel like I've got a good understanding of this problem.

**May 10, 2023**
- Completed LeetCode 704: Binary Search.
  - I got very close, but missed a few of the important small details and had to look at a solution to get to a working implementation.
  - However, I didn't have to look up a conceptual explanation, which is good - that's the hard part.
- Completed LeetCode 74: Search a 2D Matrix.
  - Was able to solve it without looking at a solution. But it took quite a while.
  - My solution isn't half bad though. And my code is relatively clean.

**May 9, 2023**
- Completed LeetCode 739: Daily Temperatures
  - Had to watch the NeetCode video to get the concept, but was able to implement the solution without looking at the solution code.
  - NeetCode's implementation was cleaner, however, and my solution had some redundant work.
- Completed LeetCode 853: Car Fleet
  - Had to watch the NeetCode video to get the concept, but was able to implement the solution without looking at the solution code.

**May 8, 2023**
- Completed LeetCode 150: Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation
  - Was able to complete the entire problem without looking up a solution.
- Completed LeetCode 22: Generate Parentheses
  - Was unable to come up with, or even get close to, a solution for this one.
  - Watched NeetCode video on how to solve this one.

**May 4, 2023**
- Completed LeetCode 20: Valid Parentheses
  - Didn't need to look up a solution.
- Completed LeetCode 155: Min Stack
  - Needed a hint, but was able to do it without looking at a solution.

**May 1, 2023**
- Completed LeetCode 567: Permutation in String.
  - Did this one without looking at any solutions.
  - However, while my solution is running in optimal time (BCR), it does include a poorly formatted loop that does not correctly check all conditions. This required the addition of an explicit check after the loop that would be unnecessary if the loop was implemented correctly.

**April 30, 2023**
- Completed LeetCode 424: Longest Repeating Character Replacement
  - Had to watch the NeetCode solution and implement a version of his solution to get it to work.
  - I very much overcomplicated the implementation of this problem. It didn't need to be as involved as I made it.
  - As far as I can tell, I focused too much on explicitly handling many of the cases that were handled implicitly. This resulted in overly complex code that was difficult to get to work.

**April 24, 2023**
- Attempted to pseudo-code the solution to LeetCode 424.
  - Didn't make much progress.
  - Re-watched the conceptual portion of the NeetCode video.
  - Tried to pseudo-code a new solution.
  - Need to break the pseudo-code down a bit more, then try to implement my solution.

**April 23, 2022**
- Watched the conceptual part of the NeetCode video for LeetCode 424: Longest Repeating Character Replacement.
  - Wrote out how the solution in my own words.
  - Next, I need to outline the pseudo-code and then implement it.
- Started pseudo coding solution to LeetCode 424.
  - Wrote out the valid window condition in a confusing way and got myself mixed up.
  - Come back tomorrow and write it down better (don't look at the old version) so it isn't as confusing. Because it's not confusing, I just over complicated it.

**April 22, 2023**
- Started LeetCode 424: Longest Repeating Character Replacement
  - Came up with a promising idea, but it has a few clear limitations (unhandled edge cases).
  - This solution does not use a sliding window, and I know this is a sliding window problem. I need to either come up with a super clever solution (never a good idea) or try to work out a sliding window solution.

**April 19, 2023**
- Completed LeetCode 3: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
  - Managed to complete it without looking at an existing solution.
  - Did have to watch the NeetCode conceptual explanation to find my error however (this was done yesterday).

**April 18, 2023**
- Continued to work on LeetCode 3: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
  - Watched the conceptual part of the NeetCode video, but was still unable to implement a working solution.
  - I should outline my solution manually again to see where my error is. I don't think I need to see the worked solution in the NeetCode video to get this one.

**April 17, 2023**
- Attempted LeetCode 3: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters.
  - Got very close to a working solution, but had one small oversight in my solution.
  - #TIP: I need to be better about coming up with test cases before coming up with a solution. I might have caught that one if I'd paid close attention to my test cases.

**April 16, 2023**
- Completed LeetCode 121: Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
  - Redid this problem as part of NeetCode 150.

**April 15, 2023**
- Completed LeetCode 11: Container With Most Water

**April 14, 2023**
- Started working through LeetCode 11: Container With Most Water.
  - Just got a basic idea for the problem and started outlining the problem.
